I just created Empty Remote repository from GitHub.com account by lickcin on the plus icon on top right corner and new repository and give a name and click create

And Cloned this repository by clicking on Set up in Desktop and (optionally select the location) click on clone

It cloned our remote repo to local so we can start working locally.
